# Blockchain

## What is it (Technically)?
- Holds accounts/transactions
- Each block is secured by cryptographic hashing
  - Validated by set of computers
- Keeps everything secure and regularly checked

## What is it (business perspective)?
- Can exchange anything of value
- You don't have to trust a third party to keep track of your transactions
- It's a network that keeps in line false or blank transactions
- Kind of like a public database
  - Trust in humanity "The network"
  - This acts as your third party network
- This creates a ledger (in public view)
- Anyone can look up the certification to verify someone's certificate.

## Decentralized Apps
- Similar to playing a game that has turns
  - block goes through the chain
- Smart contract
- Ethereum uses Solidity (language kind of like JavaScript)
  - No while loops
  - Additional restrictions
